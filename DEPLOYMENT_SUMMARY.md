# TODO App Deployment Summary

## Overview
Successfully deployed a serverless TODO application on AWS using CDK with the following architecture:

## Deployed Infrastructure

### Backend Services
- **API Gateway**: RESTful API with CORS enabled
  - URL: https://yyb7r0dmne.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/
  - Endpoints: GET/POST /todos, PUT/DELETE /todos/{id}
  
- **Lambda Functions**: 5 Node.js functions deployed
  - GetTodos: Retrieve user's TODO items
  - CreateTodo: Create new TODO items
  - UpdateTodo: Update existing TODO items
  - DeleteTodo: Delete TODO items
  - InitDb: Database schema initialization

- **RDS MySQL Database**: 
  - Instance: todoappstack-101620251947-tododatabase101620251947-86pwr44te4q1
  - Engine: MySQL 8.0.42
  - Status: Available
  - Database: todoapp

- **Authentication**: Amazon Cognito User Pool
  - User Pool ID: us-east-1_nuGJkG0dv
  - Client ID: 468ajj5rbk3gvapl562377minq

### Frontend
- **React Application**: Built and deployed
  - TypeScript-based React app with AWS Amplify integration
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile
  - Authentication UI with Cognito integration
  - CRUD operations for TODO management

- **S3 Static Hosting**: 
  - Bucket: todo-website-101620251947
  - Frontend files successfully uploaded

- **CloudFront CDN**: 
  - Distribution: https://d3sn7od5hwr63l.cloudfront.net
  - Global content delivery with SSL/TLS

### Security & Networking
- **VPC**: Private subnets for database and Lambda functions
- **Security Groups**: Configured for Lambda-to-RDS communication
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access for all services
- **Secrets Manager**: Database credentials securely stored

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- CDK infrastructure deployment
- Lambda functions created and deployed
- API Gateway configured with Cognito authorization
- React frontend built and deployed to S3
- CloudFront distribution active
- RDS MySQL database provisioned and available

### ⚠️ Pending
- Database schema initialization (connectivity issue from Lambda to RDS)
  - The InitDb Lambda function times out when connecting to RDS
  - This is likely due to security group configuration or VPC routing
  - Manual database initialization script created but requires VPC access

## Access Information

### Frontend URL
https://d3sn7od5hwr63l.cloudfront.net

### API Endpoints
- Base URL: https://yyb7r0dmne.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/
- GET /todos - Retrieve todos
- POST /todos - Create todo
- PUT /todos/{id} - Update todo
- DELETE /todos/{id} - Delete todo

### Authentication
Users can register and sign in through the Cognito-powered authentication UI in the frontend.

## Next Steps
1. Resolve Lambda-to-RDS connectivity issue
2. Initialize database schema
3. Test end-to-end functionality
4. Add sample data for demonstration

## Architecture Benefits
- **Serverless**: Auto-scaling, pay-per-use
- **Secure**: Authentication, private networking, encrypted secrets
- **Performant**: CloudFront CDN, optimized Lambda functions
- **Maintainable**: Infrastructure as Code with CDK
- **Cost-effective**: Only pay for actual usage

The TODO application infrastructure is successfully deployed and ready for use once the database connectivity issue is resolved.
