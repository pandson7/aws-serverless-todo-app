# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a TODO application deployed on AWS. The application will provide users with the ability to manage their tasks through a web interface, including creating, updating, deleting, and organizing TODO items.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Task Management
**User Story:** As a user, I want to create, read, update, and delete TODO items, so that I can manage my tasks effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user creates a new TODO item THE SYSTEM SHALL save the item with a title, description, and creation timestamp
2. WHEN a user views their TODO list THE SYSTEM SHALL display all their TODO items with title, description, and status
3. WHEN a user updates a TODO item THE SYSTEM SHALL save the changes and update the modification timestamp
4. WHEN a user deletes a TODO item THE SYSTEM SHALL remove it from their list permanently
5. WHEN a user marks a TODO item as complete THE SYSTEM SHALL update the status and display it as completed

### Requirement 2: Task Status Management
**User Story:** As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete or incomplete, so that I can track my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user clicks on a TODO item checkbox THE SYSTEM SHALL toggle the completion status
2. WHEN a TODO item is marked complete THE SYSTEM SHALL visually distinguish it from incomplete items
3. WHEN a user views their TODO list THE SYSTEM SHALL show both completed and incomplete items
4. WHEN a user filters by status THE SYSTEM SHALL display only items matching the selected status

### Requirement 3: User Authentication
**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely access my personal TODO list, so that my tasks remain private.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user accesses the application THE SYSTEM SHALL require authentication
2. WHEN a user provides valid credentials THE SYSTEM SHALL grant access to their personal TODO list
3. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THE SYSTEM SHALL deny access and display an error message
4. WHEN a user logs out THE SYSTEM SHALL terminate their session and redirect to login page

### Requirement 4: Data Persistence
**User Story:** As a user, I want my TODO items to be saved permanently, so that I don't lose my tasks when I close the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user creates a TODO item THE SYSTEM SHALL persist it to the database
2. WHEN a user returns to the application THE SYSTEM SHALL retrieve and display their saved TODO items
3. WHEN the application experiences downtime THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain data integrity and availability
4. WHEN a user modifies a TODO item THE SYSTEM SHALL update the database immediately

### Requirement 5: Responsive Web Interface
**User Story:** As a user, I want to access my TODO list from any device, so that I can manage my tasks on desktop and mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user accesses the application on desktop THE SYSTEM SHALL display a full-featured interface
2. WHEN a user accesses the application on mobile THE SYSTEM SHALL display a mobile-optimized interface
3. WHEN a user interacts with the interface THE SYSTEM SHALL provide responsive feedback
4. WHEN the screen size changes THE SYSTEM SHALL adapt the layout accordingly

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability
**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and handle my requests efficiently, so that I can manage my tasks without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user loads the application THE SYSTEM SHALL display the interface within 3 seconds
2. WHEN a user performs CRUD operations THE SYSTEM SHALL respond within 1 second
3. WHEN multiple users access the system THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain performance levels
4. WHEN the user base grows THE SYSTEM SHALL scale automatically to handle increased load
