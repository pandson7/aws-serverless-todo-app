#### Amazon API Gateway
- **Requests**: 150,000 requests/month
- **Cost**: $3.50 × 0.15 = **$0.53/month**

#### Amazon RDS MySQL
- **Instance**: db.t3.micro running 24/7 = 730 hours/month
- **Storage**: 1GB storage
- **Cost**: $0.017 × 730 + $0.115 × 1 = $12.41 + $0.12 = **$12.53/month**

#### Amazon CloudFront
- **Data Transfer**: 500 users × 50MB × 2 visits = 50GB/month
- **Requests**: 500 users × 100 requests × 2 visits = 100,000 requests/month
- **Cost**: $0.085 × 50 + $0.0075 × 10 = $4.25 + $0.075 = **$4.33/month**

## Cost Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate Optimizations
1. **Use AWS Free Tier**: Significant savings for the first 12 months
2. **RDS Reserved Instances**: 30-60% savings for predictable workloads
3. **Lambda Provisioned Concurrency**: Only if consistent traffic patterns
4. **CloudFront Caching**: Reduce origin requests and data transfer costs

### Long-term Optimizations
1. **Aurora Serverless**: Consider for variable workloads
2. **S3 Intelligent Tiering**: Automatic cost optimization for storage
3. **API Gateway Caching**: Reduce Lambda invocations
4. **CloudWatch Cost Monitoring**: Set up billing alerts

## Scaling Considerations

### 10x Scale (5,000 users)
- **Lambda**: ~$6.70/month
- **API Gateway**: ~$5.30/month
- **RDS**: May need db.t3.small (~$25/month)
- **CloudFront**: ~$43/month
- **Cognito**: ~$27.50/month
- **Total**: ~$108/month

### 100x Scale (50,000 users)
- **Lambda**: ~$67/month
- **API Gateway**: ~$53/month
- **RDS**: May need db.t3.medium (~$50/month)
- **CloudFront**: ~$430/month
- **Cognito**: Free tier covers 50,000 MAUs
- **Total**: ~$600/month

## Summary

The TODO App AWS solution provides excellent cost efficiency, especially with the AWS Free Tier:
